## Differences between Expo CLI and React Native CLI

| Expo CLI                                         | React Native CLI                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Managed workflow                                 | Manually install and configure some dependencies                 |
| Same installation steps on Mac, Windows or Linux | The instructions are different depending on the operating system |
| Limited to the Expo ecosystem                    | Full flexibility                                                 |
